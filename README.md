# Cell Placement Optimizer

A simple implementation of the paper [Local Search for Final Placement in VLSI Design by O. Faroe, D. Pisinger and M. Zachariasen](https://github.com/cascino546/cell-placement-optimizer/blob/main/local_search_for_placement.pdf)

Missing features:
- Penalties duration
- Sub-neighborhoods division
- Benchmarks on industrial circuits

Possible improvements:
- Better strategy than greedy when solutions become feasible
- Lookahead search
